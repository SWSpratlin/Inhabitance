# Thesis_TestingGrounds
 Testing Grounds for my thesis project

Unsure what use anyone else will have for this, but here it is.

CHANGELOG

03/21/2023
Updated to include VideoCollisionTest1 folder, including the Box class 

See change history for VideoCollision2 for more details about changes. 
- vector motion, simple collision
- stable "lookUnder" monitoring
- optimized PImage pixel array search 

03/13/2023
Created Repository, added PDE Files and .WAV files to one master folder. 

 TODO: organize the folder into classes, main, and Assets

 TODO: add external Libraries? Might not be necessary, but It would be nice to have everything in one place

 TODO: Fix PhysController class so it works the way I want it to, and I can finally uncomment it.
